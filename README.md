# Zero Shot Picking  

🚀 **Zero Shot Picking** is an AI-powered object retrieval system that enables a robotic arm to pick up objects from a container using only their names as input. This project demonstrates how vision-language models and advanced perception techniques can be used to perform zero-shot object identification and retrieval without prior training on specific objects.

🔹 **Video 1: Object Recognition**  
- A user inputs the name of an object.  
- The system captures an image of the container.  
- The model identifies and highlights the requested object in the captured image.  

🔹 **Video 2: Robotic Arm Integration**  
- The system is connected to a robotic arm.  
- When a user inputs an object’s name, the robotic arm retrieves the object from the container based on the detected coordinates.

## 🛠 **Technical Overview**  

🔹 **Zero-Shot Object Detection**: The system leverages vision-language models to identify objects solely based on textual input, eliminating the need for prior object-specific training.  
🔹 **Multi-Modal AI**: Combines **image processing** (e.g., SAM, GroundingDino) with **natural language understanding** to perform object selection.  
🔹 **Robotic Arm Control**: Integrates with a robotic system to fetch the object and place it in the desired location.  
🔹 **Computer Vision**: Uses advanced object detection techniques to locate and highlight objects in real-time.
